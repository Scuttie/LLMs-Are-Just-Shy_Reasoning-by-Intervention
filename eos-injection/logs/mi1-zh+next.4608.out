Final Generated Text: First, we need to figure out how many bolts of blue fiber are in 2 bolts.  We can do this by dividing 2 by 2.  This gives us 1.  Now we need to figure out how many bolts of white fiber are in half that much white fiber.  We can do this by dividing half by half.  This gives us 1/2.  Now we can add 1 and 1/2 to get 2 1/2.  This is the total number of bolts of fiber that are needed to make a robe. Next step is to figure out how many bolts of blue fiber are in 2 bolts.  We can do this by dividing 2 by 2.  This gives us 1.  Now we need to figure out how many bolts of white fiber are in half that much white fiber.  We can do this by dividing half by half.  This gives us 1/2.

Final Generated Text: First, we need to figure out how much the house is worth after the repairs.  We know that the value increased by 150%, so we can use the formula for percent increase to figure out the new value.  The formula for percent increase is:  New Value = Original Value + (Original Value x Percent Increase)  New Value = $80,000 + ($80,000 x 150%)  New Value = $80,000 + ($80,000 x 0.15)  New Value = $80,000 + $12,000  New Value = $92,000  Now that we know the new value of the house, we can figure out the profit.  The profit is the difference between the new value and the original value.  The formula for profit is:  Profit = New Value - Original Value  Profit = $92,000 - $80,000  Profit = $12,000  So, Josh made a profit of $12,000. Next step: 1.  What is the formula for percent increase? 2.  What is the formula for profit? 3.  What is the new value of the house? 4.  What is the profit? Next step: 1

Final Generated Text: First, we need to figure out how many meters he runs in one sprint.  We know that 1 sprint is 60 meters.  So, 1 sprint is 60 meters.  Next, we need to figure out how many sprints he runs in one week.  He runs 3 sprints 3 times a week.  So, he runs 3 times 3 sprints.  That is 3 times 3 sprints.  So, he runs 9 sprints in one week.  Now, we need to figure out how many meters he runs in one week.  We know that 1 sprint is 60 meters.  So, 1 sprint is 60 meters.  We also know that he runs 9 sprints in one week.  So, he runs 9 times 60 meters in one week.  That is 9 times 60 meters.  So, he runs 9 times 60 meters in one week.  Now, we need to figure out how many total meters he runs in one week.  We know that 1 sprint is 60 meters.  So, 1 sprint is 60 meters.  We also know that he runs 9 sprints in one week.  So, he runs 9 times 60 meters in one week.  That is 9 times 60 meters.  So, he runs

Final Generated Text: First, we need to figure out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the morning and in the afternoon.  We know that Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning.  We also know that Wendi gives her chickens 25 cups of feed in the afternoon.  So, we can add 15 and 25 to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the morning and in the afternoon. 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed.  So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 40 cups of feed in the morning and in the afternoon.  Now, we need to figure out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day.  We know that Wendi needs to give her chickens 40 cups of feed in the morning and in the afternoon.  We also know that Wendi has 20 chickens.  So, we can divide 40 by 20 to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day. 40 ÷ 20 = 2 cups of feed.  So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 2 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.  We can write our answer in a complete
